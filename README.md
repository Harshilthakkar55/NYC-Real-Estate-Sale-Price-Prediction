# NYC-Real-Estate-Sale-Price-Prediction
According to the National Association of Realtors, the total market worth of real estate in the United States tops $43 trillion. Therefore, we want to take a deep dive into the real estate market pertaining to New York City and create a model relevant to the same field. Our developed model could further be used to assess the feasibility of future real estate prices in New York City, either by real estate agencies, mortgage lenders, or private entities who might be looking to buy/ sell property. Or, it could also be adapted for use in different locations to help users tap into other potential markets.Therefore, we are highly motivated to take this project further and help understand the real estate industry in New York City.
