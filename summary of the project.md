Project Summary: NYC Real Estate Sale Price Prediction

Objectives: This project aims to predict the sale prices of real estate properties in New York City using historical sales data. The goal is to provide insights into the factors influencing property prices and to develop a predictive model that can assist investors, realtors, and potential buyers in making informed decisions.

Methodology: The analysis began with a comprehensive data exploration phase, where the dataset's structure, missing values, and distributions were examined. Data preprocessing techniques, including cleaning, normalization, and feature engineering, were applied to prepare the dataset for modeling. Several machine learning models, including linear regression, decision trees, and random forest regressors, were evaluated for their performance in predicting sale prices. Model selection was based on a combination of cross-validation scores and metrics such as RMSE (Root Mean Square Error) and R-squared values.

Key Results: The random forest regressor emerged as the most effective model, achieving the highest R-squared value and the lowest RMSE, indicating a strong ability to predict sale prices accurately. Feature importance analysis revealed that property size, location, and building age were among the top factors influencing sale prices in NYC.

Conclusions: The project successfully developed a predictive model that can estimate NYC real estate sale prices with a high degree of accuracy. The findings underscore the importance of location, property attributes, and market conditions in determining real estate values. Future work could explore the integration of more granular data, such as neighborhood trends and economic indicators, to further refine the model's predictions.
